Paneer lababdar is a popular paneer gravy dish and can be found on the menu of many Indian restaurants.


My paneer lababdar recipe is more Punjabi style than Mughlai style with the addition of onions, tomatoes, cashews and spices. It does not rely heavily on the usage of plenty of nuts, dry fruits or seeds. Cashews are the only nuts added in the recipe.

Paneer lababdar is truly a dish that you will always love to make for special days or festival days. Its richness, creaminess and deliciousness will wow you every time. Perfectly apt to make for festive or special occasions.
